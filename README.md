# CrimsonCache
CrimsonCache creates a synthetic blood bank database that matches the current aggregate blood donation data in the US. It’s designed for SQL practice.

# About the data
CrimsonCache creates synthetic dataset and, from that, a database. The people contained within it are not real, however, the aggregate statistics which the database models are. The sources of the statistics are [statistica][1], an article by the [Stanford Blood Center][2], and [America's Blood Centers][3].

[Statistica][4]) also provided data on changes amongst doners over time, including donations by race, and a breakdown of blood type and Rh by race for all but Native Americans and Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders. For an Rh breakdown of Native Americans I used a 93:7 percent split based on the work of this [paper][5]. Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Rh breakdown is approimated from the [Blood Bank of Hawaii][6].

The results were aggregated by blood type. For an Rh breakdown of Native Americans, I used a 93:7 percent split based on this paper. The Rh breakdown for Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders is approximated from the Blood Bank of Hawaii.

Regarding race, you’ll notice I have an unusual mix of color along with what is normally construed as race for field names, and all of it is referred to as ethnicity. I don’t believe it’s the best way of capturing diversity, but I don’t think race works either. Caucasian and African-American are ethnicities, but one could be white with no ancestors from the Caucasus just as you could be a recent arrival from Egypt whose ancestors have been in Egypt for the last thousand years. Yet, good luck telling people you’re African American. The same goes for South Africans. And I have never once seen a comprehensive list of what all the races should be or how most people are mixed to some degree or another.

However, we know conditions like [sickle cell disease][7] have a genetic component that is best described with the accurate (but wordy) “people of sub-Saharan African origin living in other parts of the world,” so dispensing with the collection is probably not a great idea. And, I just found out that Peru is close to 100% O positive, and the Blackfoot Native American tribe is about 70% A positive. So, it stays until it gets replaced by something better.

# About the schema
The schema is modified from [Blood Bank Management and Inventory Control Database Management System][8] by Aman Shah, et al. In the paper they propose a system and schema that would not likely work in the US (India has, as least notionally, universal health care; the US is mostly for profit). However, I don't think it's necessary to develop a schema that captures a fictional US blood bank *in excruciating detail* in order to create a functional dataset.
