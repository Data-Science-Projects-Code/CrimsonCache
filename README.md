# CrimsonCache
CrimsonCache is a synthetic bloodbank database that matches current aggregate blood donation data in the US. It's designed for SQL practice.

# About the data
First of all, this is a synthetic dataset. The people contained within it are not real. The aggregate statistics, however, are taken from [statistica](https://www.statista.com/topics/7512/blood-donation-in-the-us/), an article by the [Stanford Blood Center](https://stanfordbloodcenter.org/products-and-services/) and [America's Blood Centers](https://americasblood.org/statistics_guide/) and [statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1203831/blood-type-distribution-us-by-ethnicity/) provided data on changes amongst doners over time, include the donation by race. Aggregated the results by blood type. For an Rh breakdown of Native Americans I used a 93:7 percent split based on the work of this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2135301/pdf/73.pdf). Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Rh breakdown is approimated from the [Blood Bank of Hawaii](https://www.bbh.org/about-blood/)

Speaking of race, you'll notice I have an odd mix of color and along with what is normally construed as race for field names. I don't think its the best way of capturing variety but I don't think race works either. For example, you could be white and every single one of your ancestors from Ireland. But you would still be listed as Caucasian even though your ancestors were never from the Caucauses. You could be from newly arrived Egypt whose ancestors were from Egypt for the last thousand year, but good luck telling people you're African American. Same goes for South African. And I have never once seen a decent list of what all the races should be or how most people are mixed to some degree or another. But, we know things like [sickle cell disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle_cell_disease) have a genetic component that is best described with the accurate (but wordy) "people of sub-Saharan African origin living in other parts of the world" so dispensing with the collection is probably not a great idea. So, it stays until it gets replaced by something better 

# About the schema
The schema is modified from [Blood Bank Management and Inventory Control Database

In the paper they propose a system and schema that would not likely work in the US (India has, as least notionally, universal health care; the US is mostly for profit) but I don't think it's necessary to develop a schema that captures a fictional US blood bank *in excruciating detail* in order to create a functional dataset.
